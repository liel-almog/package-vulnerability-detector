# Package Vulnerability Detector

## Description

Package Vulnerability Detector is a WebAPI that allows you to send your definition file (the file that contains the packages you use in your project) and get back a list of vulnerabilities that were found in the packages you use.

This project uses the Github Security Vulnerabilities GraphQL API to get the vulnerabilities list.
